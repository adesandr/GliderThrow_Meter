Component positions for example.LYT

Fields: Part ID, Value, Package, Layer, Rotation, X, Y
Units:  Rotation - degrees, X, Y  - thou
Notes:  The X, Y value is the centre of package as drawn in ARES.
        The origin for these values is the Output Origin.
        The values are a guide only and must be checked manually when
        setting up automatic insertion equipment
